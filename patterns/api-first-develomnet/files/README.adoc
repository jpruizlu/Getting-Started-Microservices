= JHipster

== Installation

There exist several ways to install JHipster and to start working with it. The full specifications are inside its  link:https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/[website]

* JHipster Online is a simple way to generate an application without installing JHipster in the first place.
* _Local installation with NPM_ is the classical way of working with JHipster. Everything is installed on your machine, which can be a little complex to* set up, but that’s how most people usually work. In case of doubt, choose this installation.
* _Local installation with Yarn_ is the same as classical “_Local installation with NPM_, but using Yarn instead of NPM
* _Installation with a package manager_ is only available for Mac OS X and Windows. This is a very simple installation method, if you use a package* manager, but it is still in BETA.
* The Vagrant-based _development box_, with all tools already set up in a Ubuntu-based virtual machine.
* The _Docker_ container, which brings you a lightweight container with JHipster installed.

=== Pre-requisites

Following are the prerequisites to start working with JHipster locally using _Local installation with NPM_ installation.

1. Install `Java 8` from the Oracle website
1. Install `Node.js` from the Node.js website (_please use an LTS* 64-bit version, non-LTS versions are not supported_)
1. `NPM` is installed with `Node.js` but you need to upgrade it: `npm install -g npm`
1. If you want to use the JHipster Marketplace, install `Yeoman`: `npm install -g yo`
1. Install JHipster: `npm install -g generator-jhipster`

NOTE: If `Error: EACCES: permission denied, access '/usr/local/lib/node_modules'` use following instructions:

====
- Use `id -run` or `whoami` to check current user id.
- Change permissions to the entire folder: `sudo chown -R [owner]:[owner] /usr/local/lib/node_modules` or without group `sudo chown -R [owner] /usr/local/lib/node_modules`
====

Now that JHipster is installed, your next step is to create an application.

=== Create an Application

For further information refers to the following link:https://www.jhipster.tech/creating-an-app/[webpage]

==== Micro-service

In order to create a micro-service using _jhipster_, use following simple steps:

* Create a folder where the code will be generated: `mkdir microservice-examle`
* Prompt to that folder: `cd microservice-examle`
* To generate your application, type: `jhipster`
* Answer the questions asked by the generator to create an application tailored to your needs.
  - Micro-service 
  - JWT Authentication (stateless)
  - Service Discovered *Disabled* (using K8s or Isitio)
  - No cache (test purposes)
  - RDBMS database (JPA)
  - API-First Development

==== API-First Development 

Once the mico-service has been generate using RAD (Rapid Application Development), next is creating the API definition since we are using API-First Development best practice.

* Create definition OpenApi link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/examples/v3.0/petstore-expanded.yaml[yaml] into project resources `$rootDir/src/main/resources/swagger/api.yml`
* Use `./gradlew openApiGenerate` using _Gradle_, to generate the code with the controller and interfaces (`delegates`)
* Then implements the generated delegate classes with `@Service` classes.

Finally, test the application using following link:http://localhost:8080/api/pets[Url].

Remember to change the `context-path` inside the configuration file. In this case, creating a microservice we do not want extra hierarchy in the uri.

.application.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
server:
    servlet:
        #context-path: /${spring.application.name}
        context-path: /
        session:
            cookie:
                http-only: true

==== Entities

Create the entities that will become part of the application

.jhipster-jdl.jh
[source,json]
//include::jhipster/jhipster-jdl.jh[]
----
entity Pet {
    id Long required,
    name String required maxlength(256),
    tag String required maxlength(256)
}

service * with serviceClass
paginate Pet with pager
----

Run following command to add previous entities to the project

----
jhipster import-jdl ../jhipster-jdl.jh
----

Following are the files created/updated

[source,bash]
----
he entity Pet is being updated.

   create src/main/resources/config/liquibase/changelog/20190502084613_added_entity_Pet.xml
   create src/main/java/com/example/petstore/domain/Pet.java
   create src/main/java/com/example/petstore/repository/PetRepository.java
   create src/main/java/com/example/petstore/web/rest/PetResource.java
   create src/main/java/com/example/petstore/service/PetService.java
   create src/test/java/com/example/petstore/web/rest/PetResourceIntTest.java
   create src/test/gatling/user-files/simulations/PetGatlingTest.scala
    force src/main/resources/config/liquibase/master.xml
