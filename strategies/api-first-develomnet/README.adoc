= API-First Development

*API-first development* is a strategy in which the *first* order of business is to develop an API that puts your target developerâ€™s interests first and *then* build the product on top of it (be it a website, mobile application, or a SaaS software). By building on top of APIs with developers in mind, you and your developers are saving a lot of work while laying down the foundations for others to build on.
